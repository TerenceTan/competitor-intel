# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-05-04)

**Core value:** Promo intelligence per market — competitor promo activity broken down by market, accurate enough that marketing managers trust it.

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Pre-milestone: Build APAC promo deepening before Postgres migration (stakeholder pressure + soft dependency)
- Pre-milestone: Apify pay-per-run actors over Bright Data committed plans
- Pre-milestone: Nightly BigQuery → SQLite sync over Looker iframe (preserves SoS-vs-promo joins)
- Pre-milestone: 8 APAC markets in v1; IN to v1.5; CN as separate workstream; MN deferred
- Pre-milestone: Confidence/freshness in v1, not deferred (data quality is a top milestone risk)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Open question: Per-market vs. global social account split for current competitor list — verify before Phase 1 kicks off (impacts Phase 2 scope and Apify cost projection by 5–8×)
- Open question: BigQuery SoS table name, dataset, project ID, partition column — confirm with data team before Phase 3
- Open question: Calibration set sourcing for TH/VN/TW/HK/ID promo extraction (EXTRACT-05) — needs ~20–30 hand-labeled items per language during Phase 1
- Coverage note: REQUIREMENTS.md contains 36 v1 requirements; planning context referenced 32 — all 36 are mapped to phases below

## Deferred Items

Items acknowledged and carried forward from previous milestone close:

| Category | Item | Status | Deferred At |
